[![Current version on PyPI](http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sdcclient.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sdcclient)

A python client API for Sysdig Cloud.

This module is a wrapper around the Sysdig Cloud API, which is documented [here](http://support.sysdigcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/205233166-The-Sysdig-Cloud-API-Specification). It exposes most of the sysdig REST API functionality as an easy to use and easy to install python interface. The repository includes a rich set of examples (in the [examples](examples/) subdir) that quickly address several use cases.

Installation
------------
#### Automatic w/ PyPI ([virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is recommended.)
    pip install sdcclient

#### Manual
    git clone https://github.com/draios/python-sdc-client.git
    pip install git+https://github.com/draios/python-sdc-client.git#egg=sdcclient

Quick start
-----------
- If you are interested in exporting metrics data from Sysdig Cloud, take a look at [examples/get_data_simple.py](examples/get_data_simple.py) and [examples/get_data_advanced.py](examples/get_data_advanced.py).
- If you want to programmatically create an alert, refer to [examples/create_alert.py](examples/create_alert.py)
- If you want to programmatically create a dashboard, refer to [examples/create_dashboard.py](examples/create_dashboard.py)

Usage
-----

_Note:_ in order to use this API you must obtain a Sysdig Cloud token. You can get your user's token in the _Sysdig Cloud API_ section of the [settings](https://app.sysdigcloud.com/#/settings/user) page.

The library exports a single class, `SdcClient`, that is used to connect to Sysdig Cloud and execute actions. It can be instantiated like this:

``` python
from sdcclient import SdcClient

sdc_token = "MY_API_TOKEN"

#
# Instantiate the SDC client
#
sdclient = SdcClient(sdc_token)
```

Once instantiated, all the methods documented below can be called on the object.

####Return Values
Every method in the SdcClient class returns **a list with two entries**. The first one is a boolean value indicating if the call was successful. The second entry depends on the result:
- If the call was successful, it's a dictionary reflecting the json returned by the underlying REST call
- If the call failed, it's a string describing the error

For an example on how to parse this output, take a look at a simple example like [get_data_simple.py](examples/get_data_simple.py) 

Function List
-------------

Please Refer to the [Python Script Library documentation page](http://python-sdc-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the list of functions available.
